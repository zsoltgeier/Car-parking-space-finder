This Python app allows you to detect and monitor free or occupied car parking spaces from a top-view video footage of a parking lot. The app uses computer vision techniques to process the video and identify the occupancy status of each parking space in real-time.

## Features

- **Parking Space Detection**: The app allows you to mark the positions of parking spaces in the parking lot using a graphical user interface. You can add or remove parking spaces as needed.

- **Real-time Occupancy Status**: The app provides real-time occupancy status for each parking space. It displays a rectangle around each space and shows whether it is "Occupied" or "Free."
